# Alcon.Coevolution
Host-parasite coevolutionary simulation model based on the Alcon blue (Phengaris Alcon) and its two obligatory hosts (Gentiana pneumonanthe &amp; a Myrmica sp.)
This model was adapted from https://github.com/RobertDuenner/Digital_Coevolution.

Get started:
1. Place the 4 R files (User, Functions, Run and Parameterspace) together in a directory of choice.
2. Create a folder named 'results' in the same directory
3. Open the 'Alcon.Coevolution_User' file in R and set the path to the choosen directory. Make sure the paths end in a '/' (e.g. '/home/user/path/to/files/results/').
4. Hit 'crtl + a' and 'ctrl + enter' to run the simulation (or source the user file)
5. Use the 'visualisation.r' file to visualize the results
